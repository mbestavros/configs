# configs
âš™ The configuration files I use in all my everyday tools: terminal, text editor, etc. These will evolve alongside my current tool set.

Some ready-to-use generic dotfiles are provided in the root directory; see `/home` for more verbose, customized versions.

Have a look inside individual directories to read more about specific configs.
